# Project 1

## Introduction <br/>
My experiment measures reaction time (RT) in a visual search task. Participants must search for a target in scene images. Critically, I am trying to see whether scene gist can be used to guide attention and drive learning. In order to demonstrate that scene gist truly plays a role in the observed effects, I will be comparing conditions based on preview type: intact, and phase-scrambled. Intact previews are identical to the search image (without the target). Phase-scrambled previews are search images that have been transformed using the Fast Fourier Transform, removing any gist information. Therefore, I expect search to be more efficient in intact preview trials, compared to in phase-scrambled trials, as shown by RT.

## Differences between project (P1210) and actual experiment code (AE) <br/>
### P1210 has only twenty trials, with an equal number of scene category images. AE has 180 trials. <br/>
  a. Given that the feature of interest is preview type, there is an equal distribution of each type of preview in each scene category (i.e., 45 intact city street images, and 45 phase-scrmabled city street images). <br/>
  b. Condition files for P1210 are taken from the condition files for AE, which is why their preview types are not really counterbalanced in P1210. <br/>
