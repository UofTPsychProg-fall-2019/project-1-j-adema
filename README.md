# Project 1

## Introduction <br/>
My experiment measures reaction time (RT) in a visual search task. Participants must search for a target in scene images. Critically, I am trying to see whether scene gist can be used to guide attention and drive learning. In order to demonstrate that scene gist truly plays a role in the observed effects, I will be comparing conditions based on preview type: intact, and phase-scrambled. Intact previews are identical to the search image (without the target). Phase-scrambled previews are search images that have been transformed using the Fast Fourier Transform, removing any gist information. Therefore, I expect search to be more efficient in intact preview trials, compared to in phase-scrambled trials, as shown by RT.

## Differences between project (P1210) and actual experiment code (AE) <br/>
### P1210 has only twenty trials, with an equal number of scene category images. AE has 180 trials. <br/>
  a. AE's trials are determined based on preview type. 90 trials belong to each. <br/>
  b. In AE, preview types are equally distributed between each scene category. Scene categories each have 90 trials. <br/>
  c. Condition files for P1210 are taken from the condition files for AE, which is why their preview types are not really counterbalanced in P1210. <br/>
